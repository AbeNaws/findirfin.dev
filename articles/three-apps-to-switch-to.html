        <p>Here are three privacy respecting programs I recommend everyone switch to from their big tech counterparts.
        </p>
        <h3>Brave Browser</h3>
        <p><img src="../articles/images/brave-logo.png"></p>
        <p>Brave is a chromium-based browser, meaning that it will have all the features that you are used to. Some
            notable features of brave browser are:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Shields</b></li>
        </ul>
        <p>Brave's built in tracker and ad blocker, protecting you from creepy stuff across the internet. it also saves
            you data by not loading these ads and trackers.</p>

        <ul>
            <li><b>Leo</b></li>
        </ul>
        <p>Brave's private AI assistant. It can summarize articles and videos, and help you write and research. It's one
            of the most privacy respecting AIs out there</p>
        <p>Learn more <a href="https://brave.com/leo/">here</a></p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Rewards</b></li>

            them out <a href="https://brave.com/">here</a></p>


        <br>

        <h3>Signal Messenger</h3>
        <p><img src="../articles/images/signal-logo.png"></p>
        <p>There are a lot of good messaging apps out there, but my favorite is Signal. The best features are:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>End-to-End Encryption</b></li>
        </ul>
        <p>Signal provides state-of-the-art end-to-end encryption for all messages and calls. The signal encryption
            protocol is one of the most respected in the world, and signal is one of the leaders in quantum-proofing
            encryption. </p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Usernames</b></li>
        </ul>
        <p>Signal has added usernames recently, making it easier to connect with other people without using your phone
            number. </p>
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Stickers & Stories</b></li>
        </ul>
        <p>Stickers and stories are fun features that signal includes.</p>
        <img src="../articles/images/signal-messenger.png" alt="signal messenger">
        <p>You can download Signal <a href="https://signal.org/download/">here</a></p>

        <br>

        <h3>Proton</h3>
        <p><img src="../articles/images/proton-logo.png"></p>
        <p>Proton is probably the hardest switch in this list, but it may be worth it for you. Proton replaces email,
            drive, calendar, VPN, and password managers. Proton includes a pretty good free tier, but if you need more
            they have pretty good plans in my opinion</p>
        <p>Proton end to end encrypts everything, which means that not even proton can look at what you have saved. It
            is a well respected and trusted service.</p>
        <img src="../articles/images/proton-apps.svg" alt="signal messenger">
        <p>Start using Proton <a href="https://proton.me">here</a></p>

        <br>

        <h3>Others</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p><a href="https://tuta.com/">Tuta (formerly Tutanota) is another private email service that some people prefer over proton. </a></p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><a href="https://cloaked.app">Cloaked is a password
                        manager and aliasing service, with many more products on the way.</a></p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><a href="https://grayjay.app/">GrayJay is a android app that replaces YouTube, Rumble, Odysee, PeerTube, and more</a></p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><a href="https://notesnook.com/">Notesnook is a private notes app. There are a lot of good options for this, but notesnook is the one I like. </a></p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><a href="https://rumble.cloud/">Rumble Cloud is not made to be a privacy alternative, but it is a good alternative to big tech cloud services. </a></p>
            </li>

        </ul>
